The focus will be on implementing **cost-cutting measures** without sacrificing product quality. This includes optimizing inventory management to address the **excess stock problem** and introducing **dynamic pricing models** to better match market demand and competition.

We will also propose **new revenue models** that include offering bundled services and partnerships with gyms, allowing Peloton to evolve from an exclusively home fitness brand to a hybrid solution that caters to both home and outdoor fitness enthusiasts.
